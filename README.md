### Motivation

Different types of early memories have been associated with different types of emotional responses, such as, for example, **visual** memories generally being more **positive**, with **verbal** memories being more **negative**. There might even be an association between the type of memory and the **offset of infantile amnesia** (the inability of adults to retrieve memories from the first 2 to 4 years of their lives) [*]. These same associatations have not been extensively studied for memories that primarily involve a musical context. In this project, we set to find out more about the **moods**, **emotions**, and **vividness** people associate with their **earliest musical memories**.
